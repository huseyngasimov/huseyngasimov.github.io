  <p>I was born in 2003 and have been passionate about technology from an early age. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from Azerbaijan State Agricultural University. During my studies, I supported academic and administrative tasks, showing strong organizational and leadership skills.</p>

  <p>Professionally, I specialize in IT support. I’ve worked at Bravo Supermarket (Pasha Holding MMC), managing IT operations across seven branches, solving hardware/software issues, and ensuring system stability both on-site and remotely. I also have part-time experience at Markaz Market providing end-user support and maintaining service reliability.</p>

  <p>I have hands-on experience with tools and platforms such as Windows OS, basic Linux, Microsoft Office, and Google Workspace. My technical skillset includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C#, and I'm actively working towards earning my cybersecurity certifications.</p>

  <p>I enjoy learning about cybersecurity, new technologies, and artificial intelligence. Outside of tech, I care deeply about animal welfare and regularly support stray animals in my community.</p>
